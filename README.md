# Restaurant App

Just playing around with Rails/React

## Description

Simple CRUD app for Restaurants and Dishes

## Requirements

- Ruby version 3.2.2
- Rails version 8.0.2
- Postgres 17.4
- Yarn 1.22.22

## Getting Started

- Clone this repository and cd into the directory
```
get clone https://github.com/Lilia-Brown/restaurant-app.git
cd restaurant-app
```

- Make sure you have Ruby installed. I recommend using `rbenv` to manage Ruby versions.

- Install bundler if you don't have it already with `gem install bundler`.

- Run `bundle install` to install all the required gems.

- Make sure you have `yarn` installed: https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable

- Run `yarn install` to install dependencies.

- Run `rails db:create` to create the database.

- Run `rails db:migrate` to run the migrations.

- Run `rails db:seed` to seed the database with a few restaurants and dishes.

- Run `bin/dev` to start everything up.
